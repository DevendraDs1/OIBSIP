    <p><b>Ragnar Lodbrok</b> according to legends,was a Viking hero and a <u>Danish and Swedish king.</u> He is known from Old Norse poetry of the <b><i>Viking Age</i></b>,Icelandic sagas, and near-contemporary chronicles. According to the traditional literature, Ragnar distinguished himself by conducting many raids against the British Isles and the Holy Roman Empire during the <big> <b>9th century.</b></big> He also appears in Norse legends, and according to the legendary sagas Tale of Ragnar's Sons and a Saga about Certain Ancient Kings, Ragnar Lodbrok's father has been given as the legendary king of the Swedes, Sigurd Ring.</p>
    <p> <h2>Ragnar's Sons</h2>
        <p>The Great Heathen Army is said to have been led by the sons of <b>Ragnar Lodbrok</b>, to wreak revenge against King Ælla of Northumbria who had previously executed Ragnar by casting him into a pit full of venomous snakes.[51] Among the organizers were at least some of the brothers: 
            <big><b>Ivar the Boneless, Ubba, Halfdan, Björn Ironside, Hvitserk, and Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye</b></big>
            , all of whom are known as historical figures, save the slightly more dubious Hvitserk.[52] Ivar the Boneless was the leader of the Great Heathen Army from 865 to 870, but he disappears from English historical accounts after 870.[53] The Anglo-Saxon chronicler Æthelweard records Ivar's death as 870.[54] Halfdan Ragnarsson became the leader of the Great Heathen Army in about 870 and he led it in an invasion of Wessex.[55] A great number of Viking warriors arrived from Scandinavia, as part of the Great Summer Army, led by King Bagsecg of Denmark, bolstering the ranks of Halfdan's army.[56]</p><big>
